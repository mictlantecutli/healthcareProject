# Overview

The purpose of this project is to delve into the world of data analysis. I had heard about "Pandas" before, but had no idea what it meant. I see it as a very powerful and simple tool for data analysis. I was also very interested in graphing. In this project, I made a very simple graph, but now I understand how to do it much better.

The dataset I used is called "Healthcare," and it contains patient information, including the date of admission to a particular hospital, the illness for which they were admitted, and the name of the insurance company that covered their hospitalization. It's a learning dataset, but it contains all the information needed to perform data analysis (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset)

The purpose of this software are the following:
-Obtain the top three diseases. It displays the names of those diseases and the number of people with them.

-Find out which insurance companies are most frequently used and which are least frequently used. This information can be very revealing in terms of benefits.

-Obtain the most requested hospitals for the top three diseases. This may help me understand which hospital is most specialized in a specific disease.

-Graphs the top three diseases by month throughout 2019. This gives me an idea of ​​which months have the most patients with that disease.

# Data Analysis Results

-What are the top 3 diseases in the Healthcare dataset?
-What is the demand for hospitals for the top 3 diseases?
-Which insurance is most used and which is least used?
-What does the top 1 disease look like over a year based on the number of patients?

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Pandas for data analysis. For graphing, I used Matplotlib. For coding, I used Visual Studio Code. I also used a virtual environment to maintain project-specific versions. I used a Kaggle dataset.

The language I used was Python.

# Future Work

* For the option to graph the number of people with the top disease over time, I still need to implement the other years. Perhaps I should have included options so the user could choose the year they want to view.
* I forgot to analyze the billing amount. I wonder what the average expense is for a particular illness?
* Implement user input validations
